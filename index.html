                    Dear Kanade<br><br>
                    I love you (as a fan)<br>
                    I fell in love with you right at moment you spoke in your debut stream <br>
                    "Wow this girl is so loud, damn i love her already", yayyyyy new oshi for me 🤓<br>
                    I love how you always speaks in 0.75 speed which make it easier for me to understand nihongo <br>
                    I also adore your singing voice <br>
                    Namae no nai kabutsu is my favourite cover song of yours <br>
                    Well all i can say that you are my top tier oshi <br>
                    I will always be one of your biggest fan, i'm rooting for ya forever <br>
                    I wish you the best with your carrier and looking forward to what will you achieve in the future 💛

                    데뷔 때 부터 보면서 처음에는 살짝 살짝 보기만 했는데 어느 순간부터 멤버십 가입, 생일 굿즈 구매, 방송 매번 챙겨보고 있습니다.<br>
                    정말 어느 순간 '아 얘가 내 오시구나' 라는 걸 깨닫는다고 해야 할까요 최대한 응원하고 싶어지는 마음이 든다는 것이 이런 거구나 라고  훅 하고 들어오는 느낌입니다.<br>
                    앞으로도 방송과 팬 활동을 이어나가면서 응원하겠습니다.<br>

                    오토노세 카나데의 1주년을 진심으로 축하드립니다.<br>
                    첫데뷔 방송의 범상치 않은 움직임은 여러 사람들이 눈여겨 봤으며, 아마 가장 큰 인상을 줬던거 같습니다.<br>
                    비록 외국어를 못해서 주로 키리누키쪽을 보는것이 주 이지만 수요일의 노래방송은 큰일이 있지 않으면 항상 듣고 있습니다.<br>
                    또한 커버곡 홍보가 밈처럼 자리 잡혔을때 여러번 들었으며, 지금도 간간히 노래 틀어서 듣고 있습니다.<br>
                    이 글을 볼 쯤에도 많이 더울지도 모르겠지만 더위먹어서 몸고생하지 않았으면 좋겠습니다.<br>
                    앞으로도 많은 커버곡과 많은 방송, 그리고 많은 굿즈들을 발매하며 승승장구하는 오토노세 카나데가 되었으면 하는 바이며 또 홍보할때 이마에 사진 붙이는 그 장면을 다시 해줬으면 합니다.

                    Dear Kanade, Congratulations on your birthday anniversary !!!! <br>
                    <br>
                    I personally enjoy a lot of your covers you have done along with regloss. Especially Kaibutsu and daybreak as my personal favourites.  With your great voice , you have breakthrough a lot with the strength of your angelic voice that definitely makes me motivated to stay and continue watching your content . Although you do have kusogaki moments , its a fun time to watch kanade stream especially when trolling viewers or fellow holomems. <br>
                    <br>
                    Also hearing you learning about living alone has also put into perspective , perhaps some relatable moments even . Stand strong and keep yourself healthy. And to see you another year!!!

                    Congrats for debuting one year anniversary to you and ReGLOSS, Kanade! As a female viewer who started to know hololive around 2020, even though my time getting to know you wasn’t very long compared to my whole Vtuber journey, but your presence has really gets my passion and joy back for watching streams. I really like your "gaha"s, how you call us Omaera, and also your interactions with the other members of ReGLOSS. I really love the feeling of this small group.<br>
                    I also really enjoy your cover songs; they're amazing. I love your DAYBREAK FRONTLINE too, and still use it as my morning alarm. Of course, the song during your singing streams are great too! But I hope you don't push yourself too hard to stream frequently. After all, to achieve your dream as a singer, you need to take care of your voice, especially after being sick recently. Anyway, I hope you can keep streaming and singing to get your dream caome true! As an Omaera (音の勢), I will always support you! 奏ちゃん、配信も、歌も、いつもありがとうございます！ずっとずっと応援するぞ！

                    Hi Kanade, thank you for your hard work and music, and congratulations that you reach one year milestone. Sorry that I can only use English because I don't know 日本語 much. The first your stream I tuned in was "sing Shunkan Heartbeat 100 times" stream. When I heard about that stream I was a little bit worried and felt I should give some support by tuning in so I opened the stream during my work. Since then, I started listening your songs and karaoke streams. I enjoy your vocal and the expression for the songs. I can feel the passion you have in singing. Thanks for the covers you have sung. And I really look forward you will have your first original song, a song expressing your feeling, a song only belong to the one who is 音乃瀬奏. Carry on and never give up on your dream. May see you around! --- a fan of Yours

                    Hello Kanade! Congratulations for your 1st Anniversary!<br>
                    I have been your fan since you start debuting. You have a very beautiful, cool, deep, and full of emotion voice that could move everyone's heart. From that day I know that you have a great potential to be big!<br>
                    You have made a lot of great song covers and the one that I really love are "My Dearest" and "奏", both of that song really shows how great your voice control are, and I love it.<br>
                    To be honest, I have multiple oshis: suisei, kagura nana, fauna, zeta, and you. *I guess it's not important*. I think you have the same of voice as suisei, what I mean is I can hear your endless effort to make your singing better day by day, and that's what will always move peoples heart.<br>
                    Lastly, if you ever think that your effort has not paid off or your plan has ever not gone as good as you think, just remember that we otonozei will always support you no matter what, because we believe that you can do it. (Because that's what you thought us)<br>
                    <br>
                    I'm sorry for any bad english, I'm Indonesian.<br>
                    Once again Congratulations!<br>

                    奏ちゃん, 1周年おめでとうございます!<br>
                    私はkaigai-nikkiなので、今DeepLを使って翻訳している 草。まだ1ヶ月以上 配信見始めたばかりですが、クリップをたくさん見て、本当に楽しいと思いました。5月のマイクラの配信で、何でも怖がって30回も叫んだり、青くんに毎回「キモーイ」って言ったりしたのが大好きです www。奏ちゃんのクッソガキな性格が本当にめちゃめちゃ面白くて、たくさん笑って、奏ちゃんをフォローするようになりました。でも、私がファンになったのは、奏の歌い方です。最近は Regloss のオリジナル曲だけでなく、奏のカバー曲もノンストップで聴いています。君の歌はとても美しくて、言葉にできないほど心に響きました。一番驚いたのは、君が瞬間ハートビートを100回歌ったことだ。「クレイジーだ」と思ったが、君は本当にベストを尽くして、それに本当によくやった。私も歌の勉強をしているのですが、歌を歌うと喉が痛くなるのはわかる。でも、奏は本当にやり遂げた。奏がホロライブに参加してくれて、奏の歌の才能を知る機会があったことに本当に感謝します。一周年ということで、これからの旅も頑張ってください。ホロライブも大きな会社になって、本当に大変かもしれないけど、今まで通り、前向きに頑張ってください。<br>
                    改めて 1周年とおめでとうございます<br>
                    これからも応援しています！

                    <br>At that time I just started learning Japanese and loved how easy it was to understand you. Now you have become the main reason for me to be better at Japanese.
                    <br>I hope that even after 2000 years people will still enjoy your songs!!!

                <br>
                <br>First of all, congratulations on your 1st debut anniversary!!
                <br>
                <br>The beginning of my love for Kanade was when I listened to Shunkan Heartbeat. I actually didn't know Hololive before, but spotify randomly selected this song for me and it stuck in my mind every time I listened to it repeatedly. It made me wonder who the artist of this song was, and when I tried searching for it, I found ReGLOSS and found out that she was a Virtual YouTuber. At that time, I was curious, so i watched some of ReGLOSS's cover clips, but I didn't decide to follow they because I didn't know much about VTubers.
                <br>
                <br>But not long after, the algorithm showed me a lot of ReGLOSS's clips. At that time, I was in my university's Internship Program. And because my timezone and Kanade were not that different, I saw that Kanade was live streaming UNDERTALE and that was the first live stream I watched.
                <br>
                <br>Before I knew it, I always had Kanade's karaoke playing in the background while I work or study. To me, Kanade has always been a singer from the beginning until now, even though Kanade also streamed games. But when it comes to music, I admire Kanade's dedication, especially after learning that you paused your studies and moved to Japan to work with Hololive to pursue your dream of singing. I find you incredible, especially since we are of similar ages, and I can relate to the fears and loneliness of being in an unfamiliar place. That's why deep down I respect and want to support Kanade for daring to follow your dreams.
                <br>
                <br>Additionally, I'm starting to learn Japanese again because of Kanade. Actually, before I met Kanade, I was interested in Japan and had started learning Japanese. But because I was busy with university and wasn't good at the language learning skills, I felt tired and lost my drive to learn Japanese, so I eventually gave up. But when I listened to Kanade speak Japanese on live streams, it reignited my passion for learning the language. I enjoy listening to Kanade and trying to understand what she says. Even though they were simple sentences or short sentences, it made me feel like I was learning a language as a hobby, and I didn't feel as tired as I used to.
                <br>
                <br>At First, I was captivated by Kanade as a singer, but I also enjoy you as a streamer. When you whined because game didn't go your way or when viewers tease you, I feel the urge to comfort you. Or when you acted naughty with the other senpai in hololive, you were also really cute. Watching Kanade as a streamer feels like I have a younger sister, while when you sing or talk about music, you become someone truly remarkable to me. Despite the differences in these two aspects of your side, together become Otonose Kanade, the person I like.
                <br>
                <br>Even though I might have gotten to know you later than others, and there are still many things I don't know about you because I don't understand Japanese, I still want to get to know Kanade better from now on. So let's work hard together, whether it's 1 year, 2 years, or however many years go by, until all of Kanade's and my goals come true. Until that day comes, I'll continue to support you!

It brightens my day being able to listen to your music, watching you play for hours on stream, or watching funny clips on you online. Your personality is very vibrant and the contrasts between how you sing and how you talk is absolutely hilarious. Don't worry, I still keep you at 1x talking speed ̶m̶o̶s̶t̶l̶y̶!
